# urb.lua

`urb.lua` attempts to make it easy to communicate with your Urbit in Lua, while also providing utility functions relating to Urbit as a whole.

...That said, none of the "communicate with your Urbit" functionality is currently implemented. This will be done once Urbit's HTTP API stabilizes a little bit.

## Functionality

* urb core
  * Coming Soonâ„¢
* nom: ship name to/from address number conversion
  * function numtoname ( address number ) => ship name
  * function nametonum ( ship name ) => address number

## Usage

Just like `local urb = require("urb")`.

In `nom`, to support all 128 bits that can make up an Urbit address, `lib/bn` is used for numbers. If your address is larger than can be stored in a Lua integer, use `lib/bn` to pass in `bn("number")` instead.
